// printing number from 1 to 10.
// wheneverwe need to repeat the steps / process : in that case we should use the loops
// 1. while : entry control
// 2. for : entry control : steps / increment : or if you know about end limit
// we don't have the fixed criteria for condition.
// for arrays (should be traversal order from 0 to sizde -1)
// 3.  do while. exit control : is not a preferred approach in good practice.
